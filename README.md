### Hi there üëã

#### My name is Patrick and I am a self-taught/bootcamp grad fullstack developer from Germany. I am currently focused on landing a full-time, remote, entry level role as fullstack developer. 

#### Working WITH developers for about four years, has made me realise that I want to BE a developer. That's why I made the decision to, use my experience from various positions in operations, and dedicate all my time, money, and efforts, to becoming a fullstack developer.

#### I have always, and yes I mean always, been good at working on things until they do what they are supposed to do. When others stopped digging in monotone and lengthy pieces of technical documentation, I keep going until I find what I need. As a wildlife photographer I am used to sitting through long periods of time, waiting for that one moment, which by the way often doesn't even happen. But, that has made me a very patient person.

#### Here are some more things about me:

#### - üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on: A fullstack MERN app. I have also decided to use TypeScript for this project, as I would like to become familiar with it. 

#### - üå± I‚Äôm currently learning: TypeScript and the MERN stack in general (see my #buildinpublic project (currently still planning stuff - will create a repo soon))

#### - üëØ I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on: I would love to start contributing to an open source project. Being new to this, I am still trying to figure out how that works.

#### - ü§î I‚Äôm looking for help with: As I am currently searching for an entry level role as fullstack developer, I am always happy to receive any tips on open roles or companies that are hiring.

#### - ‚ö° Fun fact: 

#### - üì´ How to reach me: You can get hold of me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patricklemmer/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/patrick_lemmer), through my [website](https://patricklemmer.dev/) or via email at patricklemmerdev@gmail.com
