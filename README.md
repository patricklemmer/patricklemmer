Hi there 👋

My name is Patrick and I am a self-taught/bootcamp grad fullstack developer from Germany. I am currently focused on landing a full-time, remote, entry level role as fullstack developer. 

Working WITH developers for about four years, has made me realise that I want to BE a developer. That's why I made the decision to, use my experience from various positions in operations, and dedicate all my time, money, and efforts, to becoming a fullstack developer.

I have always, and yes I mean always, been good at working on things until they do what they are supposed to do. When others stopped digging in monotone and lengthy pieces of technical documentation, I keep going until I find what I need. As a wildlife photographer I am used to sitting through long periods of time, waiting for that one moment, which by the way often doesn't even happen. But, that has made me a very patient person.
